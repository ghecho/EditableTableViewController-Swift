EditableTableViewController-Swift
=================

Simple iOS implementation of a dynamic table with an Add button on the bottom.

This is a my port of https://github.com/ghecho/editTableViewTest using swift and making it universal.

It creates a dynamic table in which the user can tap edit to delete/move (that was the easy part for me) and add rows.

When the user is on edit mode it shows an extra row at the last row to add rows (I saw this on a couple of forums but without support for rearranging the rows)
